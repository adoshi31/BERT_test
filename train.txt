They only get the news story versions of those journal articles, and I think it improves everyone's scientific literacy to reduce barriers to access literature."	0

I am utterly delighted to be able to access this research through the harvard community, and the values which underpin this access to seekers (whereever they are on the globe) are a warm, timely and frankly needed reminder and reassurance that those values and ideals held out decades ago to a young student, should still inspire, hold true, and be lived out whatever phase in their life, and whereever they should find themself on the earth.  I realized when I graduated from Harvard and finally managed to pry myself from that environment to return to my part of the world and duties ... that Harvard is not a place - its an Ideal and enduring Vision of Heights sought, glimpsed, and yes attained.  Even in darkness (perhaps it is just night), your  harvard grad is doing everything she should - my teachers would be so pleased - and there is still so much more good to do.

"Researching how the power of imagination and vision night have affected the work of a Hong kong artist, Wai Pongyu, on socio-political issues, and intrigued by Yeats' idea that 'he has best imagined reality who has best imagined justice', I wanted to explore the relationship between poetry, art and found in this essay many references that assisted me in the expansion of ways of seeing Chinese art and artists, and suggested parallels with the dialectic explored by Wai Pongyu and Hung Fai in their recent collaborative works ""Same Line Twice""; especially where the author comments: ""a dialectic between the representational tendencies of the South (such as Semitic-Hellenistic art) and the non- representational tendencies of North (such as Northern Persian and Turkish art)Ðthis effort to understand art history as a dialectic, which so delighted Yeats, can also be seen in the work of other Germanic art historians of the age..."" for the dialectic can be between two views of one culture's art history, as well as across time.

"I am looking for cognitive and social science evidence consistent with the possibility that a society can attain an 'anti-bias' mindset that tamps down to some extent unconscious biases arising from personal morals and beliefs and from social context. If that is true, it may be the case that an 'anti-bias' political ideology is possible to derive from current knowledge. Even if that is possible, it is unknowable if it would make any difference, but unless the concept is tested, the answer will remain unknown forever. This paper is part of the evidence I am evaluating in assessing that hypothesis. The more science that is not behind paywalls, the better."	0

"I work for Natural Resources Wales, which has a number of functions including environmental regulation.  Our mission is the sustainable management of natural resources, and since many final environmental goods and services are not delivered via a market, we have a strong interest in ""the beyond GDP"" debate.  In this context I have been musing about whether there is a paradigm shift underway in Economics, and to that end I recently read Akerlov's Presidential Address to the American Economic Association in 2007 where he analyses the ""five neutralities"" which undermined the Keynsian consensus, which includes Barro's rediscovery of Ricardian Equivalence, the subject of the article I have just accessed from this site.  I have to admit that I can think of only one possible example of this in practice - Japan during the 1990's.  I find Akerlov's argument that the five neutralities all involve the exclusion of norms from utility functions quite persuasive.  Turning to the open access features of your site.  I greatly value such opportunities.  Knowledge should be treated as a public good.  During the first industrial revolution many entrepreneurs deliberately chose not to patent their inventions (perhaps because of norms like those discussed by Akerlov - it would not have been inconsistent with their social status or with the status to which they aspired to be seen to be protecting their income by the use of patents)."	0

I am presently teaching  the topic  "" the Barro-Ricardian Equivalence "", and hence, I needed access to this celebrated article, published over forty ago, yet just as relevant for today's world. Research, for better or worse, requires capital, lots of it! But it shouldn't be perceived as a bad thing for the creation of  knowledge requires herculean human efforts. A commensurate availability of physical capital  is a sine qua non. We now live in  the epoch of Data Deluge. Good accounting turns data into information. Information when processed with rigorous  research methods, yields knowledge. As citizens of the knowledge economy, straddling the globe, we should be appreciative of the efforts and money put into the creation of its most critical input (.i.e. knowledge). So, paywalls put for many articles, are more justifiable than not. At the same time, a most generous initiative by Harvard DASH to freely make available articles that are echoes-in-Eternity and other illustrious publications, for the wider public around the world, truly deserve all the plaudits and thanks.

"After getting tenure at UCLA and loving research since grad school, I had to move to NY -- and then to MD -- to be close to my family. This has been a tough transition for someone who loves research so much. Right now, I teach teach psychology at a community college where we have virtually no research infrastructure. I have no lab, for example, and no grad students or RAs. As a result I conduct a lot of research using archival data sets (e.g., census records, UNDP data, CDC data).  This paper proved to be extremely helpful to me in a cross-national study of collectivism."	0

"I'm a recent college graduate working my way toward a PhD program. One of my goals in this process is to have a research agenda well-defined and potentially even have some completed research work which I can use during the admissions process. This goal is important for my PhD endeavor: becoming familiar with a body of research helps me assess academic programs and prepare for an academic program, and also familiarity with actual research helps me get an accurate sense of what professional academics actually do.

"But, unfortunately, many journal articles are paywalled. I find it frustrating and demoralizing to hit a paywall when following a line of research citations. Shouldn't knowledge be free? Making knowledge accessible to as many people as possible maximizes the probability of someone """"standing on the shoulders of giants"""" to create new knowledge. "	
	
"I want to build a career for myself where I feel like what I do makes the world a better place, and I notice that most of the individual academics which I've came into contact with seem to share a similar motivation. So, there is a rather stark contradiction here: sharing of knowledge makes the world a better place, this is a significant objective for most of the people who publish, but access to their product is so often restricted.

"I have been working in education sector for the past 30 years as a teacher, educator and as a manager as well.

In Pakistan, we lack such research based literature on brain development. In fact,  there is lack of awareness about new research on brain development among our educational communities in Pakistan. Therefore, I have used Harvard open learning resources in my sessions and workshops for teachers and parents and for educational managers to raise awareness among them on neuroscience research. I trust Harvard resources more than any other literature in the world due to its name and also because all leading scholars of ECD use Harvard resources.  I often translate these resources in to Urdu for better understanding of the participants and teachers. Thanks to Harvard for sharing free resources to spread new knowledge around the world."	1

"Ezra F. Pratt was my maternal grandfather.  My mother, his last child born to him was out of wedlock.  Six years ago I found out through DNA that he was indeed my grandfather.  He was a multimillionaire and his addition in Holmes Grove of Malden is still standing.  He built forty-one Victorian style homes, and his streets were forty feet wide.  He named his streets in honor of his children, Elsie, Earl, Grace, and Cecil Streets.  I was told by a relative who lived in Malden, and in addition I looked up the information of the railroad tracts very close to Mr. Pratt's development.  The Malden Library sent me many articles about my grandfather when I very first suspected he was my grandfather.  I enjoy seeing photographs of the houses at line the streets he named.  Some of those houses even had speakers in them in 1895.  He was only thirty-five when he developed Holmes Grove which is amazing."	0

"I have had relatively severe bilateral HSV (herpetic) keratitis for the past 3 years and found this open-source article while looking to educate myself on treatment options. Because I have a background in biology and a high degree of familiarity with scientific studies and academic articles, I seek out peer-reviewed research that is relevant to my condition in order to stay informed. This article deals with the efficacy of gancyclovir, a topical ophthalmic gel that I have been prescribed in the past with a good outcome, but which is no longer covered by my health insurance. Part of the reason I want to be better informed about this treatment option is to be able to talk with my doctor about whether or not it would be worthwhile to prescribe and use even if not covered by insurance. This article was an excellent source of information about the ophthalmic gel itself and about treatment of HSV keratitis more broadly. I am very grateful to have been able to access the full article, as I have found that being an educated and well-informed patient leads to better dialogue with doctors and better outcomes."	1

I have focused on studying Physics and therefore did not dive to far into biology but I was very curious as to what exactly they were trying to sell as this was their only definition of their service. after learning most of the definitions online and figuring out the content, I wanted to know what they meant by 'altruistic tendencies'.

"I'm an English teacher at Boston Latin School with a unique relationship to Yeats and Sligo.  You see, my husband was born in Sligo and as a result, while we reside in in metropolitan Boston, Sligo is is where we truly live. The great plains of Moytura rises behind the house in which he was born--and coincidentally enough, Harvard's Elizabeth Gray did the Irish Texts Society translation for the manuscript which details it.  The place is layered with myth and memory--and much of my own creative work springs from this source.  As a high school teacher, in my classes, Yeats always has a place--as does the late great Seamus Heaney."	0

I found this free copy that I could access immediately.  It's nice that Harvard has this service, which I was not familiar with prior to today. However it doesn't make up for the fact that Harvard Business School Publishing is so greedy in how it sells its content.  We pay for it once through our subscription to EBSCO Business Source Premier and then we have to pay for it again when a professor want to use an HBR article as a class reading.  We should be able to link to the HBR articles in EBSCO since we have already paid for them."	0

"Sorry, I didn't quite finish the last submission. I thought there would be another entry line. Thank you for your quick and concise review of the book on the life and diary of Perpetua. The clarity of your open journal article provided what I needed to begin to sort through the historicity and religious context of Perpetua was. It also clarified the complexity of the Montanist controversy. I can see from the article that there was a bit of politics going on at the time over the ecstatic elements of the group. It is interesting that Augustine found her life and death worthy of 4 sermons. Also, that Tertullian was connected with the movement, it can be seen that there were adherents in many places, and that there was quite a variety among adherents is also clear. In addition, the fact that Perpetua lived earlier in that window of time when montanism was less well known except for in Phrygia helped me understand the progression. Propinquity has a way of helping sort out the complaints of those much removed in time from the actual events. This brief, thoughtful, and to the point review was of great help to me."	1
"I'm a grad student who has an interest in history, theology, and psychology. I heard someone saying that Perpetua the martyr was heretical, and I wanted to understand why and what this might mean.

"In an exponential world a broad mosaic of knowledge will be mandatory - going everywhere will paradoxically become part of the new labor specialization and a critical component of blending AI, Automation and Human Capabilities into a blended coherent , high value matrix. Going everywhere also helps to modify the prisms that blind us (as Stanford's Professor Robert Sapolsky is teaching his students - see also Tina Seelig, Jennifer Roberts and Amy Herman's Visual Intelligence for other example of InAttentional Blindness. While exponential technologies are providing increasing marginal returns, InAttentional Blindness in such a world is exacting an increasingly expensive burden that is compounding)"	0

My daughter has a disease which can have life threatening attacks called hereditary co pro porphyria but cant get treated or diagnosed in the US. Carolyn Treasures story rang true for us because one if the people Dr.Robert Desnick of Mt Sinai  mentioned in the story at any Sinai has been reported by us to CLIA and he was found to have messed up her reporting of her genetic testing  its a rare disease orphan act but not really rare and he and his group would lose substAntial funding We had to take her to the EU to do enzyme testing not available in the Us though developed over 10 years ago with NIH funding. The EU center told Us the disease isn't rare we knew it based on research papers and reported my daughter has a 49.7% loss on her porohyria enzyme called CPOX. When I asked   another NIH funded Porphyrias Consortium Dr Bissell who also gets NIH funding why the enzyme test wasn't used in the US he said we have DNA. Well my daughters DNA came back with no pathogenic mutations it was only under 2016 hippa that we were able to find out  she had 10 mutations on 5 porphyria gene  and. 3 mutations with an amino acid change known to reduce the cpox enzyme carried in a large percentage of the Caucasian population and a gain on cpox. My daughter has a serious clinical history. With 4 hospitalizations temporary vision loss tachycardia of 247 bp which went for 90/49 to 200/100 among other very serious signs test resumts and symptoms. We cannot access treatment because its 8k per 4 day dose and our copy is 1600 and our Dr doesn't think our insurer will cover it based on her EU test results alone. The US test results parameters calls for my daughter to produce high levels of p bg a by product of enzyme #2 when her defiecency is on enzyme #6. Its unconcianable and we took a petition to the NIH of over a 100 signatures to get better US testing with Lila Meyer via change.org. my daughtets story is like message in a bottle we found many others in her same situation really sick can't test positive in the a US and denied basic treatment	0

"After completing my PhD at the University of Melbourne, Australia in 1968, I was fortunate to spend two years (1969-70) at Harvard in the Biological Laboratories in the Laboratory of Professor Jack L Strominger. I returned to Australia and had a career with the (then) CSIRO Division  Food Science & Technology in Brisbane (1971-1993). In 1994 moved to the University of New England (UNE) in Armidale NSW and was Professor of Meat Science &Technology in the School of Rural Science and later Head of School (1999-2001). Following the death from cancer  of my wife of 40 years, I retired in 2004. I remained in Armidale  and  in 2009 was  recruited as University Ombudsman. This was a part - time position which I occupied until May 2015. At that time I was diagnosed with colon cancer. This was successfully removed and to date has not returned. I am re-married and, in 2015, my wife and I returned to Queensland to Toowoomba, which is a large regional city (pop. ca. 120,000) on the Great Dividing Range 120 km west of Brisbane. Last year I joined the local U3A and attended courses in Investing and Geology.

"My Father was an African American Army veteran who committed suicide while my mother was 3 months into her pregnancy with me. The odds to prevail and overcome the obstacles implemented to stagnate my census classification had been cursed upon me before I inhaled my first breath. My mother was a 1st generation Korean Immigrant who married a German - American soldier and had two children. Her next husband was a Filipino man whom my mother had another child. Later, my mother would have 2 more children with an African American and Melanesian mixed man, one of those children being myself. After my father's traumatic departure from existence, my mother would have a last child with another African American man. Many perceptions and probably 100 Master's thesis can be written about why my mom had kids by so many different men; however, I'll leave that open for future discussion. "

"I'm a brazilian medical student and I study here with a government incentive. My father had Parkinson disease and since I was 13 years IÕve study things related to it. A huge difficulty that I found was to find reliable sources with up-to-date data and information about the PD (and as a student I wasnÕt able to pay for each information that I would need). As we all know neurology science is a relatively new field and most of the good content is held in reference research centers such as Harvard Medical School. I remember that in the end of 2015 I was looking in the internet for news about this motor problem and found a recent post in the Harvard website telling about a research conducted that would lead to a new form of diagnosing Parkinson in life. My family had a story of a family tremor that made doctors misdiagnose my parent and be unsure about the diagnosis of PD. Unfortunately my dad died in the begging of 2015 and I couldnÕt do much. But by december of the same year I went to a congress over here,  led by the International Institute of Neuroscience Lily and Edmund Safra and met a researcher that studied  Parkinson diagnosis forms. I told him at the end of his presentation about this study and promised to email him with the article. By that period IÕm not sure if the article was ÒclosedÓ (I mean , paid) or if the studied didnÕt end and wasnÕt published yet, so I wasnÕt able to share with him. However, I went to another event this year(2017) and met him again. And now when I got home and looked for the article it was a huge surprise and a great happiness that the article was published and Òfree to seeÓ and finally replied him with the article. Who knows we may develop new techniques and forms to enhance the quality of life of those with the PD , such as my father.

"I am a professional geologist with Ph.D. in geology from Penn State.  I have worked in the petroleum and coal industries throughout my professional career (1974-2016).  I continue to be astounded by the [apparent] influence of ""motivated bias"" in my colleagues regarding Anthropegenic Global Warming.  And, by the way... although I mention that I hold a Ph,D, degree, based on my anecdotal observations, this offers little or no protection from motivated bias.  People with higher levels of education are able to craft more complex and nuanced arguments to justify their beliefs.  In any case, my efforts to understand the influence of motivation on cognition has required deep dives into the literature of cognitive and social psychology.  As I'm not at a university, I have limited access to professional journals.   I appreciate your making information available at no cost to interested persons.   Thanks very much,"	1

"Researching for an assignment on psychodynamic theory of the-self. I have realised whilst writing my paper that Freud never used the term the-self to describe the id, ego, or superego. In fact he used the term the mind, psyche and core of one's being. To try and distinguish if the id should have been described as the-self seems impossible to answer. The three id, ego, and superego rely on each other, yet also antagonise each other. Each appears to contradict the other!"	0

"Thanks to the Open Access Feedback that gives me permission to share the link to the must read and pass on to your Congressman and Senators this James Mann book,  ""Rise of the Vulcans: The History of bush's War Cabinet"".  The value of Harvard's giving deep state research analyst's like myself permission to share this book, we can copy and share the link to books like James Mann's book, ""Rise of the Vulcans: The History of bush's War Cabinet"", on Facebook with tags so that an army of investigative journalists and historians like James Mann can report on the accurate ""Intelligence"" the world needs to prosecute, convict and stop the Nazi Fascist Deep State from continuing to get away with their covert ""Continuation of Governance"" plan that suspended constitutional rights of citizens and ""legalized"" their Carl Schmitt, Leo-Strauss, Reinhard Gehlen, Allan Dulles, CIA, Mossad, NATO, Gladio Team B , Nazi Fascist coup d'etat of the US and the world.  The evidence James Mann has published in the Rise of the Vulcans confirms exactly who the perpetrators of this treasonous overthrow of our Democracy are and gives enough context for a Independent Counsel like the Iran Contra Prosecutor to prosecute and impeach them and the others in their Vast Right Wing Conspiracy.  Anyone who know of what they were doing and failed to report it should be subject to a Truth and Reconciliation commission process similar to the one used in South Africa.  There is enough evidence in this book to prove treasonous conspiracy:  Some leaders of this conspiracy to take over the country were the George Bush's War Cabinet: Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, Condoleeza Rice, Richard Armitage who James Mann calls the Vulcans).  By Harvard giving me the Dash Open Access to share this book and others like it with the world, I may be able to fulfill my primary research objective of getting a Frank Church like hearing into their Abuse of Power that is being played out by the Donald Trump administration to the horror of the Free World.

"Thank you for making this important study available, examining social media influence in the 2016 US presidential election (Faris et al). I teach a graduate seminar in a program in Communication, Rhetoric, and Digital Media. Last night we discussed Jurgen Habermas' concept of the public sphere -- a presumed space where members of the political community engage to discuss and debate ""issues of general concern."" Communication scholars Kevin DeLuca and Jennifer Peeples (2002) introduced the idea of the ""public screen"" as a supplement to the public sphere. ""Screen"" suggests a new form of communication that moves from rational deliberation to rapid dissemination of shifting messages. This morning I saw a reference to your study, and took a look at it. I think the study illustrates last night's discussion topic extremely well, and provides a timely and important real-world example. Our course focuses on qualitative and interpretive research methods -- but your study demonstrates how quantitative methods can also address critical questions of media power and influence. There's plenty there for us to discuss in a future class meeting."	1

"my story is about going back to the basics. Giving voice to Kenyan, and by extension Africa the permission to use culturally relevant and specific treatment modalities. This story/article is written from a Western cultural lens. The knowledge which is amplified here is ""White/European/Whiteman's knowledge. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. But in order for us African scholars to be of use, or relevant to our communities we must decolonize our minds. You can not use the Beck-Depression scale to screen for mental health issues in Kenya is ethically wrong. Why? Because that measure was not normed for that rural population in Kenya. You can use it, but you gotta explain to your readers what steps you took to make sure the results are valid, reliable and generalizable. This article is written as though the people were just numbers to be counted. It makes assumption that people who have low quality of life in Kenya are automatically depressed! how about the communal support systems where if your Jirani lacks salt you will share. This article perpetuates a colonized lens of demeaning African, and Kenyans. There is an emphasis that this is the first of a kind of research to be conducted in Kenya, good for you but I see a list of references. Us here in the US are fighting for our way of knowledge, our cultural practices that forms the fabric of our society to be respected and acknowledged as other way of knowing, which is significant in treating mental illness."	
"I commend you for working hard to write this article, but it disappoints me when reading it  for it sounds like a none Kenyan, African writing the article. Here we are resisting imperial/colonial knowledge, a knowledge of erasure, erasing African epistemological stand points, we are raising our voices as psychologists, psychologist to be that there is no one population who is the keeper of knowledge. I clicked on the article with a lot of enthusiasm and readiness to devour, only to be met with colonial mentality evident in the article. And to make an assumption that low quality of life in the rural areas is correlated to depression is a fallacy and should bring into question the Ethics of Research into question. I am soon to be Kenyan Doctor of psychology, and I am passionate about African mental else. Hope to see you all when I come to Kenya because even though I have criticized the article, I strongly beleive you are doing an excellent job with the little resources we have in Kenya to address mental illness. We are a strong and resilient people so to unnecessarily pathologize us is wrong. Some of what we can see as disorders most likely are normal ways of handling a situation of poverty. Major Depressive Disorder that you claim your participants were having is a debilitating condition which impairs an individual's function. There are just too many overgeneralized and generalized concepts and conceptualizations that left me shaking my head."

"  I live and work in Ottawa, Canada. I am a layman who works in a mental hospital. My lack of financial ambition does not reflect my lack of philosophical ambition. Through the Great Courses lectures on a host of topics, my Audible subscription of mostly nonfiction, and direct reading of physical or Google Play books I have been autodidactically learning for more than a decade. Often I have wanted to refer to or dig into a study mentioned in a Great Course but have been confronted with a paywall/student access of some sort and have largely given up, satisfied enough that the professors have done their homework. Occasionally I've dug to find something similar through Google."	
	
"  Today I felt inspired to write a brief proposal to my employer for a rather prosiac but potentially impactful thing and to my great surprise and joy I encountered the study I had heard of in a lecture rather easily at the top of the Google search.

It's especially pleasing since there is simply too much garbage out there cheapening the name of a """"study"""" and there are only so many hours in the day."

" The proposal - and here I can't begrudge a laugh from you learned scholars - was to supply the cleaning staff with breathable shirts while simultaneously explaining the fact that they are burning calories on the job, similar to the hotel maid study. The breathable shirts is a necessary psychological bridge because of the social construction of the smelly janitor who is forced to chose between doing a good job in a shirt that keeps all the heat in (and often shows outward signs of sweating) or being an allegedly lazy janitor. It's quite the tightrope in fact and most people haven't the faintest idea of just how much is involved in being an exceptional cleaner in a hospital until they experience it for a prolonged period of time. So, give the shirts, sell the calorie-burning angle, and perhaps we can all, patients and staff, enjoy a fresher enviroment."""	1

"I am a researcher and recent graduate working and living in the Bay Area in California, and I appreciate the accessibility that is provided by DASH. I think that so often, there is a sort of gatekeeping in academia that doesn't allow for the open sharing or appreciation of information, which then serves to limit who can understand a variety of issues in the changing world. I think that open access to this information provides greater opportunities for a vast number of people hoping to educate themselves and their communities."	0

"This story is dated as being published in 1997 but the truth of it is relevant today in 2017.   The only change is that the situation is much WORSE because the truth of the article applies to major diseases, not just minor ailments  To be brief, in 2008, I was diagnosed with severe coronary heart disease (disease that causes heart attacks and strokes) with a blockage of unknown size and location near my heart.  I was scheduled for an angiogram and told to buy nitroglycerin in case the worst happened.  I was probably faced with 2 choices:  some kind of open heart surgery or death.  Fortunately I lived in the age of the Internet and was able to search for alternatives and I discovered several products that claimed they could remove heart plaque without an operation.  After doing over a month of research and being subjected to ""scare tactics"" by ""established medicine"", I decided to try one.  The only side effect was diarrhea.  The remedy worked and I got rid of most of the plaque within 24 hours.  2 weeks later was my angiogram and the surgeons could not find anything to operate on.  I had beaten the ""incurable disease""  coronary heart disease. probably the worst killer in the world (even more than cancer) without an operation.  All along there was a cure for coronary heart disease that the FDA and Health Canada refuse to recognize.  I did some research as to why this cure gets classified as ""alternative medicine""  and it was easy to discover that powerful ""interests""  are using the clinical trial system to block legitimate cures from reaching the public.  This system has been set up to prevent quack and fake ""medicines"" from reaching the public (eg. thalidomide).  When it does that, it is doing its job.  What the public doesn't know is that it can also prevent genuine cures from coming to the market.  Such was the case of my cure which is called a ""chelation remedy"".  Why?  Too many people are making too much money from suffering and death.  When a person has open heart surgery, they take on average 12 drugs day, sometimes rising as high as 30.  In the United States alone, Americans spend $75 billion on heart medicine.  If the chelation remedy was recognized as a cure pharmaceutical companies would lose $75 billion in profits on the spot.  Other enemies would be heart surgeons, the funeral business, companies that make low cholesterol foods, and any other groups that make money from open heart surgery.  I have also found an effective non-medical way to treat gall stones (mint) and I have heard from others that Shiatsu Massage can cure hay fever and other allergies.  The entire health care industry including the clinical trial system needs to be investigated and thoroughly reformed.  As more and more people are trying effective ""alternative medicine"" and getting results, ""established medicine"" is on the way to oblivion."	0

"I am writing a novel set in the mythology of ancient Sumer. In this novel I depict the conflict between Uruk and Aratta. The city of Aratta is said to be five days travel from Uurk and then some ways into the mountains. The Zabu mountains are mentioned which may relate to the mountain region near the greater and lesser Zab. It is also near the border of the Cyprus forest which I have seen ancient survey maps pointing to this region. Further tin stone is mentioned in the walls of the city itself, and a ready source of tin would be slightly to the north of the location I am looking at. Other factors such as potential religious processional routs, the presence of a Hamazi refugee, and the fact that it is near enough to go to war with Uruk suggest that this city may have been in the mountains with access to the Zab rivers and with access to mining to the north. I am interested in researching potential sites to make various scenes in the book more authentic."	0

This article I found on the evolution of language is the latest in a long line of ""shiny new objects"" in philosophy that I have discovered. I was reading an article on aeon.co called ""Is linguistics a science?"" (and that's the reason why ""The Kingdom of Speech"" is on its way to me in the mail.)

"Made it easy to find  dissertations that I couldn't find on ProQuest, perhaps because they are too recently published? I'm currently a ph.d student, but before I enrolled in school, I did not have access to much of the knowledge that is so easily accessible to students, and i was overwhelmed to how much information is accessible to college students these days online. But when not connected with a college, that information is extremely expensive, so you have to be very careful about what you pay to read and what you don't. I think this knowledge would benefit society to be accessible, because often the research is reported in the news or on popular media sites, and is misinterpreted, overly simplified, misleading."	0

"My political view on this is that documentation of work paid for by tax dollars should be freely available but access to much of it is restricted in the name of profit and that is unlikely to change so freely available, well-managed resources for credible, peer reviewed material are valuable to people like me.

"To the extent that those of us without formal institutional access who want to pursue research can move beyond maybe-right/maybe-wrong usually anonymous Wikipedia-type resources, we will be more likely to accomplish something of value. "	
	
"This is especially relevant now that an entire generation of baby boomer scientists and academics are retiring and will therefore generally have reduced access to important, peer reviewed resources."	
	
"Any initiative that provides parity access to knowledge for that generation of scientists, the ones that will follow, and smart laypersons who want to pursue research but don't have parity access to knowledge, will almost certainly enhance society's ability to create knowledge and use it for, one hopes, good.

"Thanks for this, I appreciate open access as I believe in freely accessible knowledge. Was looking for an influential paper about the failures of Big Data and found it here. As a former academic, I lost all paid access to journals so have to mainly rely on open access to keep up with research to know/read about new developments. I believe it is pivotal that we go more and more towards the free sharing of knowledge, as research doesn't necessarily get used only in academic institutions anymore and there's lots of appetite for it outside. Furthermore, I believe academia itself should push more for not being strangled by the monetisation of its results."	1

"I am immensely grateful for free access to these articles.  As a social worker and grief blogger, my website has over 2 million visitors a year who are primarily individuals who are grievers.  As a social work it is very difficult to keep up with the cost of access to journals, but as an explainer site providing grievers and professional information, support, and education about grief it is crucial we have access to research.  There has long been a disconnect in grief between researchers, practitioners, and grievers.  Open Access through DASH democratizes information that can be immensely helpful to individuals coping with grief and the professionals that support them."	1

"Published research is freely available. We cannot charge for everything in life otherwise science will not work. Research is performed by students who do not charge their professors an ""hourly rate"". It is also performed by professors who work far beyond 9 to 5, who work during summer even when they are not paid. So, published research to a large part is an outcome of effort much more than one is paid for. Unless such an effort is made, breakthroughs in science will happen at a much slower pace. Furthermore, researchers pay for publication charges to the journals. Hence, journals cannot double-charge by asking the readers to pay for the publications. DASH is a great effort to remove all barriers in distribution of knowledge. "	0

Harvard was an educational institution that at one time expressed these competing views.  It was very much Agassiz & Church vs Darwin & Asa Gray.  Mt. Desert focused the views of Agassiz and Church.

"I'm a troubled soul by nature, always have been. I got flung out of school, got in trouble with the law, and by my early 20's was drinking too much and getting into too many fights. After a looking down the barrel of a prison sentence, I was lost. I left my job and started reading and I read veraciously, stories transplanted me somewhere; a vessel to calmer plains and pacific waters. After a few years of hard graft, I decided to try my luck and university. I tried and I was successful. But I had years of catching up to do, many damaged brain cells to repair, many insecurities to conquer. My public education was awful and I needed outside support. The internet provided the means but the great American institutions provided the raw data, the intellectual dynamite required for blowing my intellectual cobwebs off and seeking higher intellectual atmospheres. Both Harvard and Yale have been key-planks in allowing me to rendezvous with redemption. With the click of a mouse, they have provided a mine of world-class academic literature that has helped me prosper as an individual.

"I'm a former HGSE alum (Ed.D. '02, Ed.M. '93) and currently full-time faculty at a community college in Arizona.  Recently, one of our professors circulated a video stating that a Harvard University study had come out claiming that ""In 2018, Harvard University predicts only 33% of all jobs will require a 4-year degree or more, while the overwhelming majority will be middle-skilled jobs requiring technical skills and training at the credential or Associates Degree level.""  This leads the author to claim that there's this 1:2:7 ratio where every 1 job created that requires an advanced degree beyond a Bachelor's will result in 2 jobs that require a four-year degree, but 7 jobs that require a technical certificate.  Here's the link to the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEXBIO1-aEY&feature=youtu.be   The original video was created by Citrus College (a community college in Azusa, California) Department of Technical Education. "	
	
"I've been attempting to obtain the original study and just found it here, or at least this study is cited as the source.  I'm very concerned because the email discussion from our faculty has been that we shouldn't necessarily encourage or """"push"""" our predominantly first-generation, Hispanic-serving, high percentage of Pell grant recipient students into a four-year or beyond degree because the video argues that """"25% of top associate degree holders earn more than $68,000 per year but the bottom 25% of  bachelor degree holders earn less than $34,000"""" so we shouldn't necessarily believe that more education leads to higher wages.  Of course, they don't cite median or average earnings associating level of education and wages other than at the beginning in a fashion that leads you to believe that they are not entirely true. There is no empirical sources or evidence presented in the video which our faculty didn't take into consideration and they are advocating showing it to all our students.  My fear is, of course, that this would lead our students to think that a bachelor's degree is not worth the investment despite plenty of evidence that shows that it is.  Ironically, all of the faculty responding have at least a Master's degree which affords them a position as a faculty member and the privilege to participate in the dialogue.  And those who have children wouldn't necessarily advocate for their own children to simply attain a technical certificate in lieu of a four-year or professional degree.  """	0

After recently watching Ken Burns's tremendous series on the civil war, I have been reading various books to gain additional knowledge about that time.  I am only about 25% of the way through C. Vann Woodward's book--Mary Chestnut's Civil War, but find it fascinating.  I am trying to track down: (1) the original version of Mary's 1860s diary so that I can compare it to the version published by C. Vann Woodward; and (2) am hoping to track down a book with greater guidance and explanation of her diary since I don't always understand the jokes or the significance of various references, even with the additional information provided in the footnotes. (I'm enjoying C. Vann Woodward's version of it, but I'm guessing he didn't want to go into greater detail and explanation in his footnotes as the book is already over 800 pages long.  For example, he often explains what she's referring to, but not why it's important.)"

I am interest in how the media even reportedly scientific media such as New Scientist is reporting very biased coverage of Trump and the threat of populism.  I am speaking as a Christian Anarchist blocked from an anarchist fb group for standing by my pacifist convictions and not being ready to beat the 'fascists' that voted Trump into office up.  My crime to say I will stand in front of their 'supposed rape victims' and take their rape but I will NOT beat people up for having different beliefs to mine, I will not presume my beliefs are superior and that this makes me a superior person in general to anybody else.  I was blocked because apparently it is in my best interest that pacifists beat people to death to prevent my rape.  Reading the article on populism, articulated my thoughts very well and also helped me understand why the left has become permeated in self righteousness, arrogance and contempt for the ideals it is supposedly defending.  Why people are using Pussy grabber for Trump but not the supporter of the 'Heroic Rapist Julian Assange' for Chomsky or Zizek to meant just a few.  Why my rape didn't matter literally months ago but now it is justifiable reason for genocide.  Also why I can tell no difference between 'Kill the muslims to prevent my rape' to 'Kill the Trump supporters to prevent my rape'.  The article brought the reason why both are the same to light, and helped me understand the thought processes of a culture that exports its madness around the world.  What worries me most is that Anarchy and the left cannot see past its metropolitan anti populism superiority complex while anarchists who are supposedly anti hierarchal yet they are putting themselves and academia on a pedestal for no good reason and the left looks down on those who created the movement.  Lastly the puzzling question of why I was not a fascist when I voted yes to leaving UK & EU governance for an Independent Scottish Government but fascist, racist, xenophobe for voting to leave the EU.  Why exactly has wanting power to be more localised and within the reach of the community suddenly become fascist to anarchists?  Why does David Graeber think I am fascist for expecting him to live by Martin Luther King's statement that you don't pick and choose pacifism or civil disobedience, way of live occupy demonstrators should be willing to go to jail when it DOES NOT suit them - that is the whole point of civil disobedience.  I have the right to pick up my cross as Tolstoy says and march to jail and death like Gandhi, what I do not have the right to do is prevent others from this because government picked an inconvenient time to imprison me.  Pretty sure the times Gandhi and MLK were imprisoned were also inconvenient, but also vital.  Civil disobedience means imprisonment and it is the action of change the action of saying violence and death do not cower me it is the ultimate political and ethical act and yet it is being called fascist if it happens to coincide with a manicure appointment.   Yes the article was very informative and well written I would recommend as many people as possible read it because we are inundated by group think, where we set our group on a pedestal and demonise any other group, and this is everywhere, all politics right now is irrational, arrogant and self defeating."	0

It's important for establishing/re-establishing legitimacy in the work that scholarly academic research provides as so many people tend to distrust or ignore expertise--in large part because the insight and expertise is often made inaccessible or undecipherable to the public.

While one would expect a lively discussion between statisticians and theorists they seem to live in different worlds. Some concepts are: labor, employment and unemployment. As we all know, the female labor force participation rate has increased quite a bit. We know this - because of these statistics. macro-theorists have, however, not really come to grips with this and basically (though there are exceptions) describe the Household labor supply function as a non-gendered variable which is not influenced by cultural-technological changes.

"I have ARVC (ARVD) and have a pacemaker/ICD in my chest. I often use the Harvard information to clarify my understanding of some aspect of my health program. I find the media jumps all over and reports one claim this week and another next wee. Often these reports in the media conflict with what my doctors are telling me. I use the Harvard info as a referee of sorts and let me tell you the Harvard medical folk always agree with my doctors. That said, my doctors have limited time to make their case, with Harvard backing them up I get a fuller understanding on why I should keep doing what I am doing. For example, I'm on a diet that many would call Mediterranean. It have lost weight and I am keeping it off, so far. Harvard medical staff are in my corner on this. Yet, I heard a report on CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corp.) that dieting doesn't work and my body will fight to put back the lost pounds. The problem the newscast said goes all the way back to our stone age roots. I disagreed and came here looking for answers. I found them and you were right on. My new diet is delicious, my wife and I have fun cooking the healthy stuff together. We see our new diet as an improvement over how we used to eat. Staying on the diet recommended by my doctors and the Harvard staff had been enjoyable and not a sacrifice. Thank you for making all the info available that you do.

I read this article about the incredibly early date of the Jericho Tower and the possible reasons for it having been built. What shook me most though was the fact that there were 22 steps to reach the top of a 10m tower. Do the maths. Surely each of those dressed stone steps would have had a fall of 45.4 cm (c.17.87 inches). A modern staircase is usually about 20 cm or 8 inches.

"This study is very useful and would be still more relevant if the authors used the PREFLEX concept from Dr, Gerald Loeb's 1995 bio robotics paper.

In horses and other athletes with SYSSARCOSIS architecture it unifies the whole animal. Its automatic behavior frees the nervous system to make escape or capture decisions.

"I am a graduate student researching culturally aware approaches to counseling. As I dig deeper, I am discovering that multiculturalism which elevates distinctives above common causes, is contributing to the disintegration of civic involvement. The emphasis on a person's identity has become paramount at the expense of citizenship. As the authors contend, the growing ""civic empowerment gap"" is thus widening. Client empowerment is often a vital factor within the field of counseling. The information contained in this document has certainly inspired me to advocate for integrative civics education as a means of improving both individual and community health. Thank you for making it freely available."	1

I partnered with a classmate to represent American Home Products in order to defend the company against the FDA's intentions to remove Fen-Phen from the market. I found this article in the web and it was my main source of reference to prepare the case against the classmates who represented the FDA.  During my oral arguments in the case trial, most of the information that I gathered and then presented as evidence to defend American Home Products, was taken out of this Harvard Law student article.  Two other classmates represented the jury in the trial.  What was their verdict?  They denied the FDA's request to remove Fen-Phen out of the market and the Genetics professors gave my classmate an I an A for the Genetics final project."	0

"I am a retired senior who has had a lifelong fascination with science, including anthropology and the evolution of man and civilization. Due to the particulars of my unbringing, topics of this nature were never encouraged in my family or by the educational institutions I attended. In the 1950's and 60's we were directed down the paths of business and manufacturing. I ended up obtaining a B.A. in Business Administration and went on to become bored and unhappy businessman in retail sales, and so, not a highly successful one. I've read narratives of my academic heroes who relate having had a parent, teacher, or acquaintance who stoked the fires of their ambition, opening the door into a wonderous life of adventurous discovery and intellectual satisfaction, but I was not that fortunate. I may be 67 now, and I possess no degrees or credentials that reflect my body of knowledge or my avid interests, but I have time. I have years to accumulate the knowledge and insights that I have hungered for since I was a teen. Most of the online sites that are repositories of the type of information I seek charge fees too exorbitant for me to afford. This is why Harvard Open Access seems almost to good to be true for one who can't pay $20, $30, or $50 for a single article or paper. I wish to add that gaining knowledge is more than just an ego boost for me, but I love to share what I learn with my family and friends, and have considered writing a blog as well. Thanks for this opportunity to share my story, and thanks for Harvard Open Access!"	1

I love looking at the sky knowing more and more of the science of what I'm looking at.  I'm interested in the Bones of the Milky way because it's so hard to know what I'm looking at, when I see it up there in the night sky; this looks like a way of learning what is where -- a map, a way of attaching what I know to a memorable feature of what I see in the sky."	0

"I've spent the last 25 years as a screenwriter, working in both television and motion pictures.  I've recently started teaching and in the process have become more interested in long form projects, both fictional and non-fictional, that require a degree of research and even scholarship that one rarely encounters in Hollywood.  I've always had a strong interest in Ancient Mesopotamia and I'm looking forward to a more studied approach to the subject matter.  I'm not currently researching any particular story or subject.  But I am interested and very much distressed by the fact that the remaining ""ruins"" from this period are being routinely destroyed by the type of carpet bombing that is employed by the major powers in this region.

The interaction of humans and  the built interest is of great interest to me and a significant part of my day to day work involves working with developers and design teams to optimise buildings for improved health and well-being outcomes. Having information to justify health based interventions is critical to support evidence based design. Beyond the well documented benefits around occupant satisfaction, productivity and reduced absenteeism i am particularly interested in how better buildings contribute to the the broader wider public health agenda - especially how they can help in the longer term reducing prevalence of disease."	0

"I was reading a mystery novel by the American expat (now Finn) James Thompson.  He uses (John) Connolly and (Andrew) Vachss-esque antiheroes, who use vengeance...a lot.  The least likely sociopath asked the protagonist to play a tango for a woman who had succumbed to her burns, received when the protagonist's car had been firebombed.  Got that?  Well, Finnish tangos are minor key and sad, not quasi confrontative, like Argentinian/South American.  So in my head began 'In enter Zeitgeist, die nun vergangen ist,' from the Dreigrosschen Oper.  Just wanted to confirm that it was indeed a tango.  Guess my mental associations are still working.  That's how I wound up here, after a few other entries that do not address tempo.  I will read the entire article later.....but the Finns have dangerous plans for their enemies, and that needs to resolve first."	0

"I am trying to improve my running.  This work largely involves stride improvement.  My hypothesis is that my best stride is baked into my bones.   My attempts at stride improvement lie in trying to tap into my early man psyche and remember how my body was created through evolution to run.  The article was an amazing addition to my thought process and really a nice way to think about how speed changes can change my body feel and the relative energies expended.  I often run with my dog, a sight hound.  Sighthounds were one of early human's most effective tools in the killing of game.  My dog's ability to sight, kill, and retrieve small game far outstrips my own, in fact it's his reason for living.  Yet his struggles to change speeds from his optimal trot compared to me are evident.  He pants and struggles at a fast trot more quickly than I do.  This phenomenon helps me see why early humans were able to use running itself to kill animals thanks to the advantages of bipedalism.  The one thing that my dog does when he is running best is that he is not thinking about how to do it well, he just lets it happen.  For me, not thinking about my running while running is my greatest challenge.  Perhaps I would be better at it, if I did it for my daily calorie requirements."	1

"My graduate educational psychology class at the Univ. of Hawaii Manoa [Models of Cognitive Learning] recently viewed the documentary Most Likely to Succeed in two increments. Following each we had lengthy discussions about the implications of the project-based learning model that characterizes High Tech High in San Diego. We discussed the likelihood of long-term benefits of project-based learning vs. a more traditional high school education - partly based on the students in a Colorado school who resisted the shift to project-based learning because they were more interested in high scores on their high-stakes tests for college entry. Thanks to one student in my class, who accessed this dissertation as a follow up to our closing discussion to the HTH documentary, we are all able to connect more of the dots about models of engagement for high schools. As a result we realize that a key part of the ""big picture"" is the animated commitment of parents to their children regardless of what school their child enters for high school. Parental support is critical. Without it, places like HTH might be less effective than they are. Add to that the choice of the adolescent and it seems that educators and parents may be closing in on three robust variables - project-based learning, parental involvement, and choice of the adolescent (even if not accepted into a project-based charter school).

"Hello, I am looking at material for a research proposal on science discourse and ELLs in middle school settings.  I am therefore interested in this article, as it pertains to measuring academic language;  however, I am developing *solutions*.  I am looking at practices, which help the ELL work on science discourse in ways that are not cognitively burdensome.  These practices need to give immediate agency to the learner, since there is too much catching up to do, to attain the vocabulary levels of native speakers by traditional means in one school year. Working with my students in an international school, I have come to feel that reading comprehension needs to be tied to ELLs writing in the genre, which in turn needs to be motivated by engaging in hands-on science activities and discussion about these. Referencing work on cognitive apprenticeship (Collins et al) I feel that reading, writing, discussing and hands-on activities are interactive parts that, when properly sequenced and managed by the specialist, will help ELLs take control of their learning - content as well as language.  I have already completed a masters dissertation in this area, and am looking to continue my investigations of the dynamics of these languaging interactions."

It was a relief to find this material so readily available to the public, constructed in an easy to use format, provided by an institution I feel I can trust as a valid source and as a primary source since it is not an abstract like I usually find, it is an actual copy of the article for which I was searching.

"I am reading this essay in the wake of the Paris attacks of 11/13. I am reading it as an antidote to despair. I have no handle on the question of how to respond to such atrocities. I would hate to see a blatantly militaristic response, and yet, I believe that the inspiration for these attacks comes from the success of terrorists in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. These self-organized groups would not be taking a cue from a failed jihadist movement. ISIS's success, in particular, has proved inspirational to them. Whence, ISIS must be crushed ... and I contradict my better judgement."	0

"A little over 3 years ago the National Speech and Debate Association (formerly National Forensics League) began a program in China to bring over American style debate.

I came upon this resource while researching a China national circuit debate topic: Patents should not be issued for lifesaving drugs. While the full content of this article is a little dense for my debaters, they have no problems when it is broken down into smaller evidence portions.

"In 1995, I was told I was more resilient than most people and asked how I'd done it (by a psychiatrist). There is more to the story than that. Before he said that, he told me that people with my history tended to live in boxes under bridges, not have successful careers, be good Mom's and put themselves through college and graduate with honors as I had. At first, I thought he was the one who should know the answers. He was, after all, a psychiatrist. Since then I learned that psychiatrists study things that go wrong, not what makes things go right.  "	
	
"I soon realized that if I was more resilient than others with my history and I could figure out why, I could help a lot of people. That is where my journey to discover the root cause of resilience began. I was busy, raising two children on my own (I was at the psychiatrist because my marriage was ending.) I read everything I could find. I observed a lot, with particular attention to those who seemed to do well in spite of the odds. That gave me hints and clues that I began incorporating in my own life. My life got even better. Eventually, all the pieces began to come together but my successful career was in business, not psychology. "	
"I began teaching others what I learned. Results included students who overcame long-term depression,  disabling PTSD and even averting an imminent suicide. My students were experiencing more happiness, resilience, and better relationships. It got to the point where I no longer wanted to do anything else (career-wise) because helping people when I knew how was so rewarding. I left my executive position and began doing this full time and writing so I could share my techniques with others."	
I like to link my work to science that supports what I've learned and Open Access helps me do this. Including science opens doors for me to help more people--people who wouldn't listen or be interested if it did not have scientific support. 	
	
"Bottom line, Open Access helps me help others. I have spent a great deal of the past few years writing because I want to be sure what I've learned survives me so I have not spent a lot of time growing my business. As a result, I don't have the financial resources to buy all the related research. I don't limit my research to psychology. There are many other areas that are related, such as psychoneuroimmunology, quantum physics, organizational behavior, medical science, and many more. "	
	
"I have also noticed that many solutions to pressing problems are in the literature already but because they aren't pharma, they are not being brought forward. Problems like the cycle of violence, disparate impact, chronic diseases (including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and depression) all have low-hanging fruit in the literature that could solve many of the problems, thus freeing resources for the more difficult to solve situations. I'm doing my best to highlight these as best I can. "	
	
"For example, so-called corporate wellness programs are treating symptoms, not actually using Primary Prevention--which they just as easily could be doing with a much greater positive impact. "	
	
"It's one thing to not know how to solve a problem. It's an entirely different matter to know how but not use it. The second, IMO, is an ethical and moral issue. I often think our time period will be judged harshly in the future for having knowledge that would help so many who need help and not applying it broadly. Open access will help change this to something the future will appreciate."

"I was a little intimidated at first that it was a Harvard article, but it was a surprisingly easy and very interesting read. It has helped explain a lot of things to me in the history of psychiatry and psychology. I am a graduate school student currently studying psychology. I am also highly critical of my own field of study. This article has helped me understand a lot of things, mainly how much of a strong role cultural and social factors play into psychiatry. It reminds me very much of Religion, and how over time Religions have had to make compromises with their own values with the tide of social values. I might argue that psychiatry is taking the place of religion, whereas in the past one would be referred to a priest for ""problems"", it is more common to be referred to a ""professional"". Overall, this article has helped me see the many inconsistencies and arbitrariness of psychiatry. "	0

"My research involves a study of the inner workings of Australian universities, with an emphasis on course accreditation procedures. I am enrolled in a PhD where I am examining the relationship between Shared Governance Theory and Higher Education Risk Management when courses are presented for accreditation. The vast majority of Australian universities are publically owned and funded and for this reason are closely monitored by the government, although all have the right through their enabling legislation to accredit the programs leading to their awards without external intervention. No standard method has been prescribed for doing this, however, and the procedures adopted vary markedly from one institution to another. My research focuses on the commonalities and differences between these procedures which I am seeking to explain in terms of Shared Governance and Risk Management."

I'm doing research to meet with Alabama Legislators before their next (!) special session in an effort to help them understand growing costs of Medicaid. Our State Legislature completed it's regular session and one special session without a budget that fully funds Medicaid. Because Medicaid is complicated and our State Legislature is filled with young tea party mentality republicans, I hope to give them an overview of why the Medicaid budget is costly so they will perhaps abandon their cries ""cut the fat"" ""entitlement programs are out of control"" and see the Alabama Medicaid Program for the effective we'll run program it is. Since Pharmacy is one of the most costly programs I need to give them some background on the Medicaid Drug Rebate Law and from the title of this article I'm hoping that I'll find the facts to explain the Pryor Bill, which was the beginning of that program.

"After graduating from a University with a bachelors in Psychology, and attaining 23 years (and 2 months) of life experience including social, emotional, academic, cultural..etc., it is auspicious for me to have free access to scientific journal articles such as this one in order reach my potential as a future graduate student, doctor, scientist, professor, author, and overall human being.

So that if by chance someone other than a researcher chooses to investigate the latest findings on this problem we call schizophrenia, there is a place they can go without an unnecessary hassle of closed access.

I have been an environmental attorney for 25 years:  I began studying environmental issues 15 years before that.   The most important thing I have learned is how little I know:  Most critical issues we are confronted with are extremely complex.

"I foresee a challenging future for my children; recent generations have had the good fortune to enjoy certain unusual economic advantages that appear to be rapidly disappearing.

About 20 years ago I began to feel that we no longer had the luxury to make bad choices:  The costs and opportunity costs with those choices increasingly limit future options.

"Greetings to everyone. xxxx is my name and I am a student from Nu Vision High School here in Rwanda. I am 16 years old and I am student aspiring to study at Harvard. After being rejected because i didn't have my SAT, I have made it an initiative to study my undergraduate from there. I am a contestant in the East African Essay Competition 2015 and basically that's how I stumbled upon this article and to be honest, it was highly useful. Well, I am very passionate about sciences( and do really good at them) but I have a passion for arts like History and Literature. I am very happy to be abl to share my story because it is kind of a sad one. After getting admitted in 3 high schools; oxford high school, darrow high school and layton christian academy, I was too unfortunate to find the fees there to high for me to achieve and that was after receiving my Harvard rejection. At oxford they reduced the fees to US $15500, at Darrow all the financial aid packages had been depleted and the fees still were (US $55000)and at Layton they reduced it to US $16800. I am not sure if by ""share your story"" you meant me pouring out my entire heart on the blank of a screen but I am really happy I am doing it because I am shy about it and since it happened recently in May, I am trying to recover from it. On the other hand, I haven;t lost hope because at first I thought that the only way of getting into Harvard was through joining an American high schoola dn completing my high school from there but I am not an open-minded person and I know that if God wants me to first go to high school there then it shall be done( i don't how or in which way but It shall be done) and if I am supposed to stay here in Rwanda and finish my A'levels then I will but one thing is for sure, I am going to study my undergraduate at Harvard the only worry is when. Thank you and I hope you will publish such even more often. What I wanted to ask form you is whether you can tune me in on techniques or ways to gain a Harvard admission. I got an SAT score of 1740( 510 Cr, 630 Maths, 600 Writing, 9 essay). I was happy for this score because I only had a month to study and I did my best.

I have yet to fully comprehend, intellectually and emotionally, how significant your research is to my understanding of myself, my family, and our place in these United States. As an academic, I know how strangely insulated the research world can be, so I express my thanks to you and to Harvard for making these stories available. If you have interest, I'll gladly share my mother's sentimental account of the Hulm family and other documents of interest. My grandfather wrote numerous letters to the editor of various papers and letters to politicians throughout his life. A cherished artifact is a photo of him shaking hands with John F. Kennedy. You have my deepest thanks, and I cannot wait to begin hearing from other family members as they read your work, especially my father who turns 80 this year, and who, I believe, has little knowledge of the legal processes his parents went through. Again, thanks."""	1

"While researching a graduate level paper on schizophrenia & how, during early encoding of memory, the anterior right hippocampus shows ""significantly less"" activation than healthy controls (J. Hall, et al, (2010) Hippocampal function in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Psychological Medicine, Vol. 40, 761-770.) I read the article cited below on the Hippocampus and Imagining the Future. In the DASH article, the anterior right hippocampus is described - even though the phrase isn't used - as the region most closely associated with imagination. One wonders if there might be a parallel here to ADHD manifested by the brain slipping into Theta waves, with hyper-activity an outward demonstration of the need for stimulation. Perhaps our brains also need imagination to function at a certain level in the right hippocampus, and if they cannot, we over-compensate and resort to delusion. "	0

"I am one of the person cited in the article of open access, Andile Maxwell Hawes. I am relatively new in the field of history research but determined to learn more. The article has prompted me to explore why early converts had mostly  male kids mentioned in their history. The people in question is James Dube and Thomas Hawes."	
	
"I have noted that both of them had sisters who were married by Reverend L Daniel in 1858 and James's sister was Nontibane who married Sipanuka from Tafamasi and Thomas's sister was Noziqoko who married Filepi. The early marriages did not consider the family names and particular of women. In the first marriage certificate of Thomas Hawes the family name of the first wife, Unjase is not mentioned and this make it difficult to trace the lineage using the written history. The interesting thing was that the wives will be known by their father's names. Unjase's father was uMnadi from the Cele stock. I have not yet been able to trace Mnandis family. If Mnandi was Christianised, it would be very difficult to trace the family not unless uNjase had an exempted certificate. In this case no records of exempted certificate of Thomas could be traced."	
	
The lesson that one has learnt is that written records can be misleading and should be supported by a very strong oral history which is very difficult to find. The experience has taught me that one should to be able to separate anecdotes which common in black history from historical facts.	
	
Another important tool to research the history of black people is family salutations (Izithakazelo). Izithakazelo are always written in codes which mostly are in a language that is not understood by most people.	
	
The Gobas are known as Jangaza (se) Mbambo and no one can explain the combination of the two words but down the lines it also say nina abamndayi ngambili. Mbambo family name is also found at Mthethwa clan. My conclusion with this mndayi is that it means a nation. I am now inclined to say the Gobas are constituted by the two clans namely the Gobas and the Mthethwas. It is for this reason that tracing the origin of Loel Hawes is difficult. The early families had polygamies and only the matrimonial trace could assist to improve the family tree. The conclusion that I have arrived at is that Mbambela was part of Mbiyane family whose son was Klas/Klaas Goba. The location of houses and the family ties in doing things and photos give me a sense of comfort. Andile also bears the features of Cetshwayo Goba.

It was apparently never followed up as a potential drug. It was never patented, either for composition of matter or utility, and neither of these options would be possible today due the prior art. It could yet be a very important therapeutic agent. We are trying to find out what creative, alternative paths might be available to provide the economic incentive for drug development of molecules in this situation.

"I am learning about the chronic and acute effects of air pollution on senior citizens.These effect include the cognitive effects on the brain as well as diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.  there should also be indirect effects on the brain from organs that deliver oxygen to the brain i.e. heart and lungs. Furthermore  PM 2.5 and smaller particles that cause inflammation in blood vesels affect all blood vessels so all the organs of the body and their products should  be affected.  In addition, since senior citizens have been around for the longest period of time, they have been exposed to chronic pollution for their lifetime. They are the most likely population to suffer the effects of chronic low level (as well as high level ) pollution. My conjecture is that these health problems may not be a natural problem in the aging population and might be eliminated if pollution is brought under control. So far everything I have read supports this. Open access allows me to follow up on these searches without having to spend money that I do not have."	0

Fred and I have known each other for many years, since we were both graduate students studying with Charles Taylor at Harvard and doing research in the archives and libraries of France.  We have shared discoveries and ideas since the mid 1950s (particularly concerning ""feudalism""), have collaborated on a joint research project, and have known and admired a host of fine historians from many parts of the world.  We have entered the digital world together, and have profited from (and been frustrated by) much of what it has brought.  I have urged Fred for many years to have his thesis scanned and made available to the many people throughout the world who are interested in his research and what he found when he worked in the rich archives of the Parlement of Paris.  I am overjoyed that he and Harvard are making the thesis accessible, and I will be announcing the good news to a group of Capetian historians organized in Paris under the direction of Elisabeth Lalou, Dominique Barthlemy, Xavier Hlary, and Romain Telliez, first by email, and then at our meeting in Paris at the Sorbonne on 21 March 2015.

Article has made me think.	
	
The article states:	
"Observations and some theory thus suggest that deglaciation increases volcanism."""""	
	
The article does not look at typical distribution of glaciation and typical volcanism on the planet.	
	
Perhaps the statement should be made causal rather than as an effect off.	
"Increased volcanism causes deglaciation, decreased volcanism increases glaciation."""""	
	
"It is perhaps the """"cause of"""" not an """"effect of""""."	
	
Volcanism's heat is 3/4 underwater.  Volcanism is three mid ocean ridges in southern hemisphere and southern circumferencial around Antarctica.  Variation in this southern heat source drives heat transfer south to north and hence glaciation.  The south does not get glaciation it is northern.  Mid ocean ridge and flood basalt is majority underwater.	
	
Volcanism is variable. Variation is capable of climate changes as recorded based on analysis by order of magnitude.

"Long story short, when i was 11 years old I made my life goal to time travel. From that age on I went to the city library about once a week to rent books about Einstein, Newton, Galileo, physics, cosmology, geology, history etc. Basically anything about revolutionary science (and their theories) which when introduced changed the entire world's understanding about reality; what is true? What is accurate? What is possible? I was preparing myself, while in my youth, to become an astrophysicist such that I could understand the entire nature of reality as the universe and thus influence/guide/explore this phenomena called ""time"". About 9 years later, while taking my final for a ""mathematics of theoretical physics"" class (at the University of California at Santa Barbara) my mind burped out an immediate epiphany about what time, the universe and reality actually were...observation/perception/attention. That is to say, I came to the realization that the universe wasn't out there on the piece of paper I was solving Hilbert spaces with, it was in my brain's innate ability to recreate a sort of mirror image reflection of the ongoing conditions of the presently observable environment (in this case the desk, the physics final, my pencil along with the hand and arm attached to it). I was so intrigued by this new point of view about the universe that the following semester I changed my major from physics to psychology/neuroscience. The reasoning behind this was that although my physics education would teach me the appropriate mathematical equations for calculating various systems in the universe (and their changing states) it would never inform me about the nature of consciousness, memory or attention. In addition, a contributing factor for changing my field of study worth mentioning is my tenacious curiosity about the science of psychedelic interrupt envelopes and how they affect the modalities responsible for multisensory binding and neuroplasticity. From personal experience (experiments), and the observations resulting thereof, I found myself fervently searching and educating myself about every knowable fact and concept about how ""mind-manifesting"" substances could create temporal perceptions as varied as seeing time freeze to watching the future happen in one's mind's eye only to watch the exact scenario unfold before one's physical eyes moments, hours, days or years later. So much for long story short, but to sum things up I spend most of my free time after work or on the weekends continuing my education in understanding time in the brain. I may have graduated college a few years ago but I never slowed down the pace of my education or accumulation of understanding. In fact, I think I may be learning more now on my own reading scholarly PDF files than I did at any point in my college career (except maybe during finals week or the day before a test...haha i'm sure i'm not the only one). Finally, the whole reason for me attempting to make my long story short was so that I could take advantage of the opportunity to offer my greatest sentiment of graditude and thanks for the existence of Open Access. It is a truly wondrous resource for people like myself who can't afford to continue our education (i.e. go to graduate school) but, just as influential as the financial burdens, also cant afford to cease our education because of the cost of ignorance on our conscience. I set a goal 14 years ago to travel through time, not to change the past or as a way to tour historical events, but instead out of an extension of my own awareness attempting to grasp at a comprehension of the reality of time and my place in it as a self-aware, sentient being. Once more, thank you for all the knowledge that an intellectual pig like myself can glutinously indulge in and ponder over!"	1

I currently have to travel 35-40 miles one way to access a research library that I pay membership fees for, or pay $100 a month for online access to technical papers. I'm grateful that this service is available. Thank you."	1
"I am an online doctoral student. The digital access to scholarship at Harvard assists me in obtaining my Ph.D. in Social Psychology. This is valuable to me because not only am I a Jr. High dropout and an older student, I am the first in my branch of the family to obtain college degrees and my ongoing success has inspired my brother, my sons, and my husband to obtain degrees of their own."	0
"I was so pleased to find Charles Rosenberg's classic essay on the therapeutic revolution available in open access.  While I have a couple of Harvard degrees including a Ph.D., I am currently an independent scholar and public intellectual.  My teaching is largely through blogging. With Open Access, I can write about 19th century medicine in a blog post and then link to the full article.  This allows me to point a much larger pool of readers to a landmark piece of scholarship, and gives them a chance to learn in more depth.  There's no use producing knowledge if it's buried in a locked library or behind a firewall."	0

The second poster confronted the first poster with the findings and actual information, and the first poster deleted his arguments from Reddit in response. "	
	
"As a function of Reddit, users are up or down-voted based upon the written responses they make in a given forum thread. The defunct poster was successful in convincing more than 400 users to up-vote racist content and false data, before the second poster was able to read the Harvard article and disprove his theory. Due to the popularity of Reddit, it is conceivable that the defunct poster would have become even more popular and spread disinformation across the internet, and people would not even have thought to check on the veracity of the article before accepting it as truthful. "	
	
"As of this email, the second poster has more than 3,500 up-votes with their analysis of the defunct-poster, complete with citations depicting the study's actual conclusions. "

We aren't ""there"" yet, but we hear the traditional texts telling us that we are justified by faith alone (too many citations to list), and we know many people of faith, especially women and the GLBT community, have been rejected by the traditional power structure of the Christian Church.

"I teach Earth Science at a Community College. On that meager salary and the small budget available to me I cannot afford to pay for scientific papers to share with my students. Also, as a professional, I am often consulted on the veracity of various scientific or pseudo-scientific claims made in the popular media. In order to verify or de-bunk a claim, I need to consult the scientific research. I recently hit a wall in a discussion because an opponent of climate change cited a paper that cost $40 to download.

"I was quite delighted to peruse the item, ""Mosaic Physics and the Search for a Pious Natural Philosophy in the Late Renaissance.""  It added to knowledge which I had already garnered from many years of research in three different fields, namely, historical theology, intellectual history, and counseling.  Having done six years of research in church history (some 3000 5x8 notecards covering more than 250 sources), written a Master's thesis in American Social & Intellectual History, a prospectus for a doctoral dissertation in Black History at Columbia University, carried out a project for a Doctor of Ministry degree on the subject, ""Christian Love & Race Relations,"" and obtained a Master's in Counseling, and research in a number of areas within the preceding designations, e.g., two years of research on Agape love in the pericope, I Cors. 12:31b-14:1a, I think the Pious article enlarged my perspectives on an approach to biblical teachings over 40 years ago.  This was when I was writing my thesis on a biblical teaching and its effect on people over a 100 year period (1750-1850).  I slowly and painfully came to the supposition that, if the Bible was inspired by Omniscience, then one ought to expect a profundity of wisdom and knowledge commensurate with such a source.  The experience of a Native American friend provides a metaphor that indicates the nature of Scripture.  He was fishing on a mountain stream in Virginia and decided to cross the stream to the other side.  He said he looked down and figured the water was 2-3 feet deep as he could see the grains of sand rolling along the bottom. He stepped off into water 18-20 feet deep and almost drowned.  As a former Atheist and one more oriented to intellectual aspects of life, it made quite an impact on me to see that the Book that I had once considered as junk was deeper than I could possibly conceive.  Like my cousin, when he was in the navy, who was invited by the captain of his ship along with the other sailors to go swimming in ""the deepest swimming hole in the world,"" I found that I was dealing with a book of ideas and other elements (literary masterpieces, scientific realities, and an optimism utterly unbelievable (a future for the earth of anywhere from 20,000-900,000 years plus man's settling of the planets of far away solar systems).  I have found that the reality of the intellectual element, that is, the way the ideas are presented to influence behavior, is of such a nature as to make a person balanced, flexible, creative, constant, and magnetic. Sad part about it is that few people are interested."	0

"I'm currently doing genealogical research on a Plymouth ancestor who was hanged in 1648 for murdering her four-year-old daughter, so I was excited to get access to Laurel Thatcher Ulrich's article, to learn more about the period in which my ancestor lived, and the way the Puritans viewed, valued, and vilified women. I've read Ulrich's books ""Good Wives"" and ""A Midwife's Tale,"" and I'm inspired by her work as a historian, and the way she can piece together scraps of primary sources to give us a vivid window into the past. I wouldn't have been able to get this article without Open Access, and I'm really grateful for the opportunity. Thank you."	1

"In the latter part of the 1980s, a handful of Australia's Rural towns (<10) became alarmed at a growing tendency for their local residents to 'Outshop' and resolved to do something about it."	
	
They thought they saw an answer in a promotion developed in the USA's mid-west in the late 1940s). That promotion -'Shop Locally'- had proved reasonably successful; County after County had succeeded in convincing their local Communities to reconsider 'Outshopping'. (I.e. resist the temptation of the seemingly 'brighter lights and 'greener pastures' of distant towns.	
	
"But the USA had only one issue to confront; Australia had two and it has been that failure to see the 2nd issue that has led to their Traders (small to medium sized retailers, usually owner operated and shopping strip based), slowly drowning in a rising tide of dead and dying stock. "	
	
'Shop Locally' has been a complete disaster. This paper has been instrumental in having towns accept that 'Shop Locally' is not for them and to see why they will need to reconsider their respective positions. 	
	
"As matters stand, Traders are now considering an alternate solution to their problems; that solution has the distinct advantage of being the same as is needed to resolve three (3) of the most difficult and long-lived issues facing business (and any Advertiser/Marketer) worldwide; the effectiveness of the Advertising budgets; the efficiency of the Marketing spending and the precision of the PR budgets."

"Open access is essential for those of us currently outside of the academic community. Many continue to do research, writing and even teaching outside of the mainstream of academia and with all such endeavors one is constantly encountering new horizons and new issues previously unknown but yet both relevant and interesting. So, e.g., during some discussions recently the debate between Einstein and Bergson came up, something none of us involved in the discussion knew about in any depth. DASH provided a nice piece for us and while it is appreciated we of course wish that all relevant secondary sources on this topic could be available to us. We're grateful to Harvard for the forward-looking view that academic treatments ought to be openly available and we look forward to more such access in the future."

I am curious as to the implications of new findings and how this research will affect the ways in which humans see one another in the future.

"These points of view fascinate me, and ring true. Yet despite all the many forms of deadness described in the article, Stravinsky, putting all those ""dead"" bits of material together, created a cohesive, live, thrilling and powerful work. The marvellous singing of the soloists and chorus of the 1951 Cologne recording (Stravinsky conducting; Peter Pears, Martha Mdl, Heinz Rehfuss) vividly expresses the pity of Oedipus' tragedy. And there is, for me, the same mute but agonizingly strong appeal in Stravinsky's statis figures as in the wooden-headed figures of de Chirico, all the stronger for their confinement.  "	0
"The pro-life movement is finally transcending the question of whether or not the unborn human being is, in fact, a human being.  As the debate turns toward the ""personhood"" of the unborn, the main distinction drawn by this essay will become indispensable to the pro-life cause.  The author seems to be aware that a certain school of thought is presently gaining popularity which proposes that legal personhood ought to be based solely on cognitive ability.  Needless to say, certain animals and computers function cognitively at a quantitatively higher level than the unborn human being.  However, if a logical argument such as the one presented in this essay can point out that rationality is proper to the human species and absent in non-rational animals and computers, the latent abilities of human beings may come to be respected in such a way that their innate personhood is recognized and appropriately protected.  Thank you to the author for his help in this matter."	1

Without free access, I would not be able to afford to conduct the literature research I require for my degree progress. Of course my institution affords me access to many research articles, but very far from all those I might desire to refer to. Thus the decision of institutions conducting and publishing research to provide open access to their articles to the public has greatly facilitated my education. If one day I no longer belong to an institution that provides institutional access to scientific articles, I will be entirely dependent upon the generosity of such entities for the furtherance of my personal and scientific growth. In principle, the fruits of scientific progress should be made available to all, in order to foster public awareness and understanding of science - otherwise vital knowledge about mankind, the world, and man's place in it will belong exclusively to the minority that can pay for it."	0

"The province I live in majority is French. Many ditch high school at a premature age in pursuit of other economic gains. In Qubec, 50 years ago, the public College system was implemented to stimulate trades and professions otherwise unattainable to the French mass, seeing the class structure was English oriented."	
	
"In 2011-12 when the Occupy movements gripped the world, the Qubec student balked at the prospect of paying the difference on tuition during Liberal austerity measures (especially at a 200-400% increase within a decade for a simple undergrad BAC degree). ''Maple Spring''. "	
	
The leaders that managed the province for the past decade failed in their attempt to appease the fundamental privilege each person has to education in this province and so they were voted out for a different party with outdated ideals.	
	
"Now the province is marching steadily to a second election within 18 months since minority government inspired change due to corruption and disenfranchised Canadian sentiment. The motives are secular, hate inspired and bias - seeing the media is intertwined with politics like it was in Italy with former PM Silvio Berlusconi, the separatist moguls here are eroding the base of identity to bargain a third referendum in 34 years."	
	
"I fear for Qubec as it may whitewash the progress it has made as a collective.

"Generally the erstwhile investor comes late to the retirement altar, drawn there after years of recklessly reinforced spending and with an attitude of unaffected simplicity, nourished by a opaque sense that the certainty of time will always present future opportunities to plan for a secure retirement. Earning a living and seeking compensatory material rewards from labor are the twin sirens that tame the spirit against an Ann Ryan like self interested sacrifice in the service future security. The financial services media and its mavens disseminate an unending host of contradictory advice, statistics, blogs and white papers that taunt our procrastination. Personally, I feed on most of it, and the effort brings rewards. It is only when you acquire an ability to connect the dots in the retirement planning maze and develop a sensitivity to the impending needs and costs associated with living outside of the workforce in later age that a disciplined inquisitiveness of possibilities emerges.

The gift of these power poses is that not only do others perceive a more confident, cabable, and able individual, but I am convinced that by practicing these poses in the mirror, those who are struggling with their own perception of their power, and helped and encouraged and begin to see themselves as more powerful, confident, and able.

"Looking at the production function which specifies a perfect substitutes relation between the intermediate goods produced by unskilled and skilled workers, I must say that such construction is not correct. The final goods need both kinds of labor and to think that they are substitutes does not say a true story. More over the final good is equal to the intermediate good (the cheapest) and only employs one kind of labor where no labor is needed to produce the final good. Finally is not intuitive to say that in any period one firm knows how to make a technological advance in either sector. This would imply that innovations occur one each period, and, which firm is the one that knows? I did not finish reading the paper since I didn't agree with the beginning of the construction.

"To be clear, I know nothing of Najarian, but I do know a great deal about Stanislaw Burzynski, and the inaccuracy of the claims around Burzynski casts doubt on the rest of the paper, and indeed on the writer's critical judgment. "	
	
"At the time of writing this paper, it was abundantly clear that Burzynski operates in an ethical vacuum. The head of his institutional review board has a vested interest in the treatment, three consecutive FDA inspections have highlighted identical red flag issues with the IRB."	
	
"Burzynski himself is not a board-certified oncologist, and appears not to understand basic concepts such as pseudoprogression and ischaemic necrosis. His prognoses are wildly optimistic; this alone seems to account for the number of people who go to his clinic. In reality his survival rate seems to be no better than chance would predict, especially since most patients have already undergone conventional therapy. "	
	
"Nearby hospitals routinely have to pick up patients with severe adverse reactions, and often fly them home using charity funds as Burzynski has left them destitute. Yet he surrounds himself with such a cult of personality that even those he has manifestly failed, speak up for him."	
	
"He has made millions of dollars from patients on """"clinical trials"""" which his own lawyer admits are a sham, and despite registering over 60 trials with the FDA, he has failed to complete and publish a single one. He's been selling an unproven treatment as if it's proven for over 35 years, and has never shown any sign of acknowledging that he carries the burden of proof for demonstrating its efficacy. "	
	
"The trials were put on hold in January 2013 due to the death of a patient, following which it became apparent that serious adverse events were not reported for years, records were falsified and destroyed, and Burzynski could not even account for the amount of drug in circulation. "	
	
"His problems with the FDA and Texas Medical Board stem from his own incompetent science, from the ethical violations at his clinic, and from his unwillingness to follow the same approval rules that every other manufacturer has to follow."

"Information matters. Life began when some information got a way to replicate itself. Since then, life has evolved by quantitative (and somehow qualitative) increases in the replication, storing and transmission of information. Eventually, original replicators got a way to produce complex organisms with organs to store, process and transmit information by their own: brains. Open Access is only one of the last links in this vital and universal chain. Given that information matters a lot, open access to information matters a whole world."	0

"I was 12, undiagnosed autistic, very intelligent, and a victim of sexual abuse from foster siblings and bullying at school, when my parents finally started homeschooling. They did not know if it would work - if they could teach me effectively, if I would cooperate for learning. All they knew was that they were afraid for my mental health if I stayed in regular schooling."	
	
"They started out trying to teach me with essentially the same methods at home as the school had been using. But I couldn't handle that. Being told what to do made me scared, and I coped with this fear by defiance. What should have been educational was turning into daily battles. So my parents backed off."	
	
"I may not have been teachable, but I was very good at learning. A typical characteristic of autism is intense interests. In my case, these interests revolved around psychology and genetics. I started with simple Google searches, but soon my interest led me to seek more scholarly sources of information."	
	
"So here I was, in my mid-teens, not registered with any university, but searching for articles on PubMed, visiting my local university's health sciences library, reading articles on ring chromosomes, deletions and duplications. And, most importantly, I was happy. I was curious, excited, enthusiastic. I was not afraid."	
	
"It was around this time that I discovered high functioning autism, and began to find a framework to understand my own differences. My official diagnosis came at the age of 15, by which time I'd already extensively read both scholarly sources and personal accounts of high functioning autism. I realized I was not rude, lazy or stupid. I simply had a different kind of mind. better at some things and worse at others."	
	
"Throughout my homeschooling, I did not produce work, nor cooperate with testing my abilities. But my excited monologues about my latest discoveries made it clear that I was learning. And this impression was confirmed when I finally managed to take the SAT in order to enter university."	
	
"And now, I'm an undergraduate psychology student, but in many ways, I feel more at a graduate student level. I still can't make or keep a study plan, but I can easily follow what my teachers are saying. I have learnt how to write papers and take tests to show what I know. I am not working up to my potential, yet, but I'm learning and enjoying life, and gaining experience to help me achieve my dreams."	
	
"If I had not had access to scholarly journals, I would certainly know a lot less than I do. I would not have had nearly as much success in university as I've had, and my future would be much more uncertain. Although I was cognitively capable of university-level material at 13 or 14, I would not have been able to prove it, nor could I have coped with any formal education (even university courses, which are really fun). My only access to knowledge, beyond what my parents could tell me, was what I could find on my own."	
	
"I'm lucky to have had parents who were students and university employees. But many children don't have this 'in' with university. They may be just as smart as me, and in some cases just as challenged, but without the advantages I've had. For these students, the only way they can learn about their passions and build confidence in their own minds is through open access journals."""	0

As a student in Cognitive Neuroscience it is always valuable to keep up on the research being done at other institutions.

We are have to do five write-ups during each semester and this was one of the articles I chose as it deals with memory retention and accuracy between working memory and short term memory.	
" Everything we learn is about how we store and recall information and than using it. Events are encoded differently and in different locations especially depending on emotional content and the value we place on it whether we realize it at the time or not. What may be tramatic for one individual may not be for another. Why? I believe it has to do with how we learn to process the information and encode it as children. I have strong feeling that while we learn all through life, the reactions to stimulaus are defined early on and with out learning new ways to process events old pathways will dominate the thought process (for example PTSD, anxiety, ect). Given the harshest one person can hold it togather and another looses it and gives up. This is a cognitive process; the brain can be tought to think and use new pathways and the old pathways will be pruned out over time because they are no longer useful. Adaptation does not just fall under the domain of Darwin but it is a constantly changing process the brain undergoes throught life and this is what I am driven to understand.

With the advent of the internet, massive online open courses, and citizen science intitaives, we live in a time when the dissemination and construction of knowldege should be and can be an endeavour open to the public.

"One has to be awed by the work that Thomas B. Edsall does for readers of the NYTimes: integrating nuggets of leading research from various disciplines into compelling edifications about American politics. My present download is from a link in one of his columns. The more that leading work is available to the intelligent public, the better our chances for cultivating bipartisan progressivism in the U.S. Journals do need to protect their cost coverage, but we need as much access to good research as we can get. "	
	
"I wish that leading academic journals could have standing relationships with leading public media, such as the NYTimes, such that any journal article linked from that media's own articles would be a readable download for subscribers to that media. It would be so great (e.g., not having so many JSTor inhibitions) that I'd gladly pay more for my monthly subscription to the NYTimes, as part of their agreement to contribute to a Creative Commons of sorts, like is done for photocopying on campus these days. Why not have open access to all journals that become affiliated with a national academic funding mechanism capitalized by all those progressive billionaires who rightly wring their hands about the quality of public culture in this age of Internet simulacra, where all opinions are treated equal, and fewer and fewer persons find time to deliberate or read carefully because the market for distraction is relentless.

"I am a Family Physician in Ontario where much debate is developing on the success (or failure) of primary care collaborative teams over the last 5 years. While these teams have varying structures they are often ""virtual"" and not co-located. I have a team that is co-located and highly successful. I believe some of our successes are due to mingling and face time of various professionals that ordinarily would not be in physical contact. It is with great interest that I have searched for your evidence that may support this hunch. As we tackle the challenges of meeting the emerging demands for primary healthcare we would do well to consider this information."	0

"I will be brief. Since February 2013 I have had a website up on Mars, which includes a gallery of surface and orbital images for which I am gradually providing geological information (still much to do). This latter task, however, is often not easy, the original images from NASA and ESA frequently being bereft of geological data and whilst there is a lot written on Mars that is available on the Internet finding reliable information takes some work. I am not a geologist, my background being in the history of science; I have spent a lot of time acquiring and reading scientific papers in an effort to provide the users of my website something that helps them to understand Mars a little better.

I've been challenged, of course for leaving out Kant. So I decided to look further at his logical imperative and insistence with not lying. To me not lying removes a barrier to the oppressive state closing down sources of news without which the rights of Man cannot be defended. So access to scholarly articles provides a way of non academic and less formal institutions spreading the fruits of academic scholarship to communities world wide without specific knowledge of the keys and entrance points to the academic word."

I am an independent scholar writing for publication to disseminate my research and enhance employment prospects.

I have been in corporate wellness since 2000 and the debate over the ROI of corporate wellness has been going on for over a decade running a company called Health Fairs Direct.

"As the publisher of the journal in which this article appeared, I regret that I have to point out that you have not had permission to place it on the web. The journal is available very cheaply in print form (about 7 dollars per issue) and this price is only possible because there are a large number of subscribers. If the articles become available on the web, the print journal will not be viable. If it were desirable to publish a web-version, I would do this commercially and the profits would be used to support the journal. In theory open access is a good idea, but in reality its impact is less good. I realise that this is a draft version of the article, but the fact that it contains mistakes (e.g. in the penultimate footnote), corrected for the published version, reflects badly on the journal, which is quite unfair. Please clarify what your policy is. People without the print version can, after all, obtain photocopies via inter-library-loan, and Publishers Licensing in the UK transfers the fees to the journal."	0

"Open Access, when it is available in general, has allowed me to continue to pursue academically developed thought so that I may continue learning outside the domain of a structured curricula that a university would otherwise provide, and most importantly permit me to continue to develop and assemble academically viable research toward the theories of history and human evolution that I have been attempting to construct for so long. I have specifically been attempting to assemble theory that explains the strands of human inheritance formation largely from a sociobiological or evolutionary biological perspective predicated on fundamentals of a thermodynamic context within the scope of human physiology. As those with experience in similar quests know quite well, it is a very broad topic that requires immersion in many subdisciplines of academic thought that only the availability of pertinent documents can provide.
